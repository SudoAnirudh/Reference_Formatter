MLA (Modern Language Association) style is commonly used in the humanities. It uses an author-page citation system.

In-text Citations:
- MLA format follows the author-page method of in-text citation. This means that the author's last name and the page number(s) from which the quotation or paraphrase is taken appear in the text, for example: (Smith 163).

Works Cited List:
- The Works Cited list appears at the end of your paper and provides the full citations for all the references you have used.
- Title your list as Works Cited (centered) at the top of the page.
- Entries are organized alphabetically by the author's last name.
- All citations should be double-spaced and have a hanging indent. A "hanging indent" means that each subsequent line after the first line of a reference is indented 0.5 inches from the left margin.

1. Author.
2. Title of source.
3. Title of container,
4. Other contributors,
5. Version,
6. Number,
7. Publisher,
