APA (American Psychological Association) style is commonly used in the social sciences. It uses an author-date citation system.

In-text Citations:
- When using APA format, follow the author-date method of in-text citation. This means that the author's last name and the year of publication for the source appear in the text, for example: (Jones, 1998).
- A complete reference for each source should appear in the reference list at the end of the paper.

Reference List:
- The Reference List appears at the end of your paper and provides the full citations for all the references you have used.
- Title your list as References (bold and centered) at the top of the page.
- References are organized by the author's last name in alphabetical order.
- All citations should be double-spaced and have a hanging indent. A "hanging indent" means that each subsequent line after the first line of a reference is indented 0.5 inches from the left margin.

Examples of citations for different materials (general format):
- Book: Author, A. A. (Year). Title of work. Publisher.
- Journal article: Author, A. A. (Year). Title of article. Title of Periodical, volume(issue), pages. DOI (if available)
- Website: Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). Title of page. Site name. URL
